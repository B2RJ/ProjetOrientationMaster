<p>This project takes place during my studies at Lyon 1 University.<br> 
I have to implement an intelligent intersection for autonomous cars.<br>
I choose to use a FIFO to manage the intersection. I had some optimizations, it is possible to have two, three or four vehicles on the intersection if their directions are compatible.<br>
Other functionalities are to be implemented in the issue.</p>
